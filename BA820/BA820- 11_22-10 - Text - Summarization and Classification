song continued to evolve during the Zoo TV tour, as Bono introduced an extra verse, which came to him out of nowhere one night in North Carolina in March 1992. Known to fans as Hear Us Coming, it asks God a series of questions, ending with, \"Do you hear us scratching/ Will you make us crawl?\" \"It allows a chance for anger and the focus of that wrath is best kept for religion itself,\" Bono says. \"In the Hebrew Bible, this level of spleen is allowed in the imprecatory psalms: King David shouting at God.\" He once said that this turned One into \"sort of a protest song against God, from a believer\": yet another take on a father and a son.\\n\\nIn January 1993, Michael Stipe and Mike Mills of REM teamed up with Mullen and Clayton under the name Automatic Baby to play One at an MTV Rock the Vote concert to celebrate Bill Clinton\\'s inauguration. Bill Flanagan describes the scene in his fly-on-the-wall book U2 at the End of the World: \"When Stipe sings, \\'We\\'re one but we\\'re not the same, we get to carry each other\\', he is using the song – however hopelessly – to plead a case and make a promise to this whole country. That\\'s a lot of weight for a song to carry! One is a pretty strong song.\" (Stipe actually changed \"get to\" to \"got to\" halfway through but the moment vindicated it.)\\n\\nThe song\\'s fluidity is a thread running through Flanagan\\'s book: \"One seems to have an infinite capacity to open up, and U2 shows no inclination to tie it down.\" In Germany in May 1993, amid a political storm about immigration, Bono dedicated One to \"the immigrants to Deutschland\". In July of that year, it followed a satellite-linked conversation with a friend of the band in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. Bono told journalist Niall Stokes how, in certain contexts, One \"suddenly becomes what it is about that night.\" It is a sturdy, inviting vessel for whatever emotions are circulating in the room, or the country, for there is always conflict and the hope of resolution. \"I have been reduced to a puddle by it myself in the most differentiated environments,\" Bono says.\\n\\nEdge\\'s favourite memory of performing One is from Madison Square Garden in October 2001: U2\\'s first New York concert after 9/11. \"After that show, all of the first responders who were present invaded the stage and it became this kind of group therapy session,\" he recalls. \"It was a really humbling thing just to be present as a witness, leave alone being the catalyst for it. It was unforgettable.\"\\n\\n\\'An unfinished song\\'\\n\\nBono initially resisted naming the ONE Campaign, the non-profit he co-founded in 2004 to fight extreme poverty and preventable disease, after this \"very bitter song\". Nonetheless, it has become a popular choice for U2\\'s benefit concert appearances: for Bosnia in 1995, for Tibet in 1997, for Nelson Mandela in 2003, and at Live 8 in 2005. That same year, U2 performed it at a fundraiser for victims of Hurricane Katrina, bringing Mary J Blige on stage for the second verse. While learning the words two years earlier for a tribute to Bono, she had begun thinking about 9/11 and its aftermath. Later, it came to encompass the human catastrophe of Katrina. For her, the lines \"Love is the temple, love the higher law/ You ask me to enter and then you make me crawl\" represented the broken promise of America. \"The United States say they care about us and stuff like that, and we got to go through so much,\" she told journalist Gavin Martin.\\n\\n\"Mary J Blige brought the song places I couldn\\'t possibly have been or understood,\" Bono says. \"I don\\'t know exactly where she went, or the names she put on the places, or the problems she was trying to solve with her interpretation, but I felt them so strongly.\"\\n\\n\"She made it her own in a way that is kind of amazing,\" Edge agrees. \"Same lyrics, same melody, but it felt like it was a different song when she sang it.\"',\n"," 'BRATTLEBORO, VT—Rubbing his hands together in what appeared to be more anticipation than he could contain, local man Dennis Kaili stated Tuesday that the dollar bill currently dangling from a fishing line right there along the path he was walking sure did look enticing. “By gosh, that’s one good-lookin’ buckaroo, ain’t it?” said Kaili, a wide grin reportedly spreading across his face as he took in the sight of the dollar, a hook, and the fishing line, which disappeared into a row of bushes. “And it’s ripe for the pickin’, too! If I jump on it real fast, I’m sure I could grab it. Don’t look like there’s anyone ’round gonna beat me to it. Yup, that dollar’s as good as mine!” At press time, sources confirmed Kaili was being pulled along the sidewalk with the hook in his cheek and still struggling to get the dollar bill off the line and into his pocket.',\n"," 'The five biggest Chinese mining companies in Congo that focus on cobalt and copper mining also had lines of credit from Chinese state-backed banks totaling $124 billion.\\n\\nRace to the Future Players in the clean energy revolution are increasingly caught in a cycle of exploitation and greed over resources. At the center of it is the quest for a prized metal: cobalt. Global Rivalries: The competition for cobalt, used in electric cars, has set off a power struggle between China and the United States in Congo. How the U.S. Lost Ground to China: Americans failed to safeguard decades of investments in Congo, essentially surrendering resources to China. Key Takeaways: The Times dispatched reporters across three continents drawn into the fight. Here are some findings from their investigation. Hunter Biden’s Business Ties: A firm co-founded by the president’s son facilitated the sale of a cobalt mine in Congo to a Chinese company. Here are the deal’s details. How Electric Car Batteries Are Made: It all starts with prized minerals and metals like cobalt.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the government-backed companies, China Molybdenum, which bought the two American-owned reserves, described itself to The Times as “a pure business entity” traded on two stock exchanges. Records show 25 percent of the company is owned by a local government in China.\\n\\nCongolese officials accuse Chinese mining companies of cheating the country of promised revenues and improvements.\\n\\nThe Congolese are reviewing past mining contracts with financial help from the American government, part of a broader anti-corruption effort. They are also examining whether Chinese promises to build roads, schools, hospitals and other infrastructure were kept.\\n\\nSeparately, Chinese Molybdenum is being accused of withholding payments to the government at its Tenke Fungurume cobalt and copper mine. The company said it had done nothing wrong, and questioned if there was an organized effort to undermine it.\\n\\nChina has an idiom that goes something like: “Where there is a will to condemn, evidence will follow,” a spokesman said. “Vaguely I feel that we may be caught in the gaming of greater powers.”\\n\\nThe purchase by the Chinese of an American-owned mine was facilitated by a firm with Hunter Biden on the board.\\n\\nTenke Fungurume, one of the biggest cobalt mines in the world, was controlled by an American company, Freeport-McMoRan. Then it was sold in 2016 in a series of transactions worth $3.8 billion to China Molybdenum. The sale was aided by a Chinese private equity firm that bought out a minority owner in the mine.\\n\\nA founding board member of the private equity firm was Hunter Biden, son of the American president. A Washington company that had been controlled by Mr. Biden remains a shareholder in the firm, according to Chinese financial documents. Chris Clark, a lawyer for Mr. Biden, said his client “no longer holds any interest, directly or indirectly,” in the Washington and Chinese firms. Filings in China show he is no longer a board member of the Chinese firm. Mr. Biden did not respond to requests for comment.']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":58}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"B-hn5KlMcBgn"},"source":["docs = nlp.pipe(articles)\n","\n","# extractive summaries\n","articles_df = td.extract_df(docs, metrics='readability')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hNSjX-fPcBdD","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":319},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637617046030,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":110,"user":{"displayName":"Yilun Wang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"12667714364550598412"}},"outputId":"524027b2-ded5-4c7c-d245-81fc95ff4977"},"source":["articles_df"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>flesch_reading_ease</th>\n","      <th>flesch_kincaid_grade</th>\n","      <th>smog</th>\n","      <th>gunning_fog</th>\n","      <th>automated_readability_index</th>\n","      <th>coleman_liau_index</th>\n","      <th>lix</th>\n","      <th>rix</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>The song continued to evolve during the Zoo TV...</td>\n","      <td>75.029716</td>\n","      <td>8.259602</td>\n","      <td>10.052491</td>\n","      <td>11.470455</td>\n","      <td>9.741378</td>\n","      <td>8.036648</td>\n","      <td>40.039773</td>\n","      <td>3.96875</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>BRATTLEBORO, VT—Rubbing his hands together in ...</td>\n","      <td>78.313636</td>\n","      <td>8.191948</td>\n","      <td>8.418075</td>\n","      <td>10.883117</td>\n","      <td>9.709532</td>\n","      <td>7.105697</td>\n","      <td>36.298701</td>\n","      <td>3.00000</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>The five biggest Chinese mining companies in C...</td>\n","      <td>69.606379</td>\n","      <td>8.022337</td>\n","      <td>10.924579</td>\n","      <td>11.337931</td>\n","      <td>10.353046</td>\n","      <td>10.998084</td>\n","      <td>43.670498</td>\n","      <td>4.62069</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                                text  ...      rix\n","0  The song continued to evolve during the Zoo TV...  ...  3.96875\n","1  BRATTLEBORO, VT—Rubbing his hands together in ...  ...  3.00000\n","2  The five biggest Chinese mining companies in C...  ...  4.62069\n","\n","[3 rows x 9 columns]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":60}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2U-9_PsTcX5X"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"kJxDEclj3ShQ"},"source":["## FUN PRACTICE AND THOUGHT EXERCISE - SHREK MOVIE TRANSCRIPT\n","## You could practice and think about readbility by using the Shrek transcript\n","## lets think about the reading model:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index\n","## are we supplying a proper dataset if we use the Shrek movie transcript?
